# Event fields
{: #event}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} events are based on the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.
{: shortdesc}

The CADF standard defines a full event model that includes the information that is needed to certify, manage, and audit security of applications in cloud environments.

The CADF event model includes the following components:

| Component | Description |
|------------|----------------------------|
| `Action`   | The action is the operation or activity that an initiator performs, attempts to perform, or is waiting to complete. |
| `Initiator`| The initiator is the resource that makes an API call and generates a CADF event. The event that is triggered depends on the action that is requested by the API call. |
| `Observer` | The observer is the resource that creates and stores a CADF record from information available in a CADF event. |
| `Outcome`  | The outcome is the status of the action against the target. |
| `Target`   | The target is the resource against which the action is performed, attempted to perform, or is pending to complete. |
{: caption="Table 1. Components that are available in a CADF event model" caption-side="top"}


The following fields are included in each Activity Tracker event:


## action (string)
{: #action_field}

This field indicates the action that triggers an event.

The format of this field is the following:

```text
serviceName.objectType.action
```
{: codeblock}

Where

* `servicename` is the name of the service.

    There is an exception on the `servicename` that is set for actions reported by the VPC infrastructure. The format of the `servicename` is composed of 2 parts that are separated by a dot (`.`).

* `objectType` describes the resource or resource attribute on which the action is requested.

* `action` defines the task requested by the initiator.

    Some valid actions are: `activate`, `add`, `apply`, `approve`, `authorize`, `bulkdelete`, `create`, `copy`, `read`, `update`,`delete`, `backup`, `build`, `capture`, `clear`, `commit`, `configure`, `deploy`, `disable`, `enable`, `end`, `get`, `import`, `init`, `inspect`, `list`, `monitor`, `notify`, `pull`, `push`, `provision`, `restore`, `start`, `stop`, `undeploy`, `update`, `receive`, `reimport`, `remove`, `send`, `set`, `setkeyfordeletion`, `unsetkeyfordeletion`, `set-on`, `set-off`, `authenticate`, `renew`, `revoke`, `allow`, `deny`, `evaluate`, `notify`, `reset`, `rotate`, `ack-delete`, `ack-restore`, `ack-disable`, `ack-enable`, `ack-expire`, `ack-restore-over`, `ack-rotate`, `ack-sync`, `edit`, `publish`,  `write`, `pause`, `refresh`, `resume`, `unsetkeyfordeletion`, `failover`, `split`, `expire`, `unwrap`, `wrap`, `rewrap`, `head`, `expire`, `reapprove`, `export`, `start`, `stop`, `pause`, `resume`, `power-off`, `reboot`, `soft-reboot`, `hard-reboot`, `power-on`, `rename`, `rescue`, `reload`, `scale`, `search`, `reject`
