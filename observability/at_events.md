# Auditing events for {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}
{: #at_events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} service to track how users and applications interact with the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.


## Managing auditing events in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account
{: #at_events_rollout}

You can manage auditing events in an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account in any of the following ways:
- By configuring {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account

    You can use {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search, an IAM enabled service, to manage auditing events through instances that you provision in each {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} region where you operate.

    {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search routes location-based auditing events to an {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} instance in the region where they are generated and routes global auditing events to the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} instance that is provisioned in Frankfurt. For more information about locations where {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} generates events, see [Locations of {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} events](#at_events_locations).

    For more information about how to configure {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started).

- By configuring {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account

    You can use {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}, a platform service, to manage auditing events at the account-level by configuring targets and routes that define where auditing data is routed.

    {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} routes events based on the location that is specified in the `logSourceCRN` field included in the event. You can define a target, the resource where events are routed to, in any {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} supported region. However, the target resource can be located in any region where that type of target is supported, in the same account or in a different account. You can define rules to determine where auditing events are to be routed by configuring 1 or more routes in the account. You can define rules for managing global events and location-based events that are generated in regions where {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} is supported.

    For more information about how to configure {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-getting-started).

    {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} can only route events that are generated in [supported regions](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-regions). Other regions, where {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} is not available, continue to manage events by using {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search.

### Viewing events managed through {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}}
{: #at_events_ui_atracker}

{{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} routes events based on the location that is specified in the `logSourceCRN` field included in the event.

You can define a target, the resource where events are routed to, in any {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} supported region. However, the target resource can be located in any region where that type of target is supported, in the same account or in a different account. For more information about supported targets, see [Targets](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-atracker-resources#atracker-resources-targets).

You can define rules to determine where auditing events are to be routed by configuring 1 or more routes in the account. You can define rules for managing global events and location-based events that are generated in regions where {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} is supported. For more information, see [supported regions](/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-regions).

To view events, you must access the target and download the object.


### Viewing events managed through {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search
{: #at_events_ui-at}

{{site.data.keyword.at_short}} hosted event search routes location-based auditing events to an {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} instance in the region where they are generated and routes global auditing events to the {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} instance that is provisioned in Frankfurt.

Events that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.atracker_short}} are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service instance that is available in the same location. For more information, see [Services generating events by location](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-cloud_services_locations).

{{site.data.keyword.at_short}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_short}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the web UI through the IBM Cloud UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch).
