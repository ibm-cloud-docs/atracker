# Auditing events for context-based restrictions
{: #events_context_based}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} to track how users and applications interact with the Context-based restrictions rules and network zones in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

The {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service records user-initiated activities that change the state of these resources in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

To get started monitoring your user's actions, see [IBM Cloud Activity Tracker](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started). An initiator can be a user, a service, or an application.
