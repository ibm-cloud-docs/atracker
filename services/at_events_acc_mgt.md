# Auditing events for account management
{: #at_events_acc_mgt}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service to track how users and applications interact with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} account.
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. To get started, see [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started).

## Events for managing IAM account settings
{: #at_events_acc_mgt_acc_iam}


**Change to Activity Tracker events that report IAM account setting changes** : With immediate effect, you can track changes to IAM account settings by monitoring the `iam-identity.accountsettings.update` event. This event is now generated by the IAM Identity service. Next time you change an IAM configuration setting, you will get an event with action `iam-identity.accountsettings.migrate` that informs you that IAM account settings are reported by the IAM Identity service in your account. If you monitor changes to IAM account settings, you might need to migrate your resources to monitor `iam-identity.accountsettings.update` events.

## Where to look for the events
{: #at_events_acc_mgt_ui}

Events are available in the **Frankfurt (eu-de)** region.

To view these events, you must [provision an instance](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-provision#provision) of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the **Frankfurt (eu-de)** region. Then, you must [open the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch).


## Analyzing events
{: #at_events_analyze}




### Catalog events
{: #at_events_analyze_2}

You can find the value `unavailable` in catalog events. This value indicates when an update is made, but specific details about the update aren't included.
{: important}



### User management events
{: #at_events_analyze_3}

This section explains events that are generated when you manage users from the **Manage** &gt; **Access IAM** &gt; **Users** dashboard.

When you analyze user management events, `target.name` is set to the user ID of the user on which the action is requested.


#### Modify the status of a user
{: #at_events_analyze_3_1}

When you modify information about the user status from the **User Details** section, you get the following 2 events:
* Event with action `user-management.user.update` that reports a request in the account to modify the user's properties.
* Event with action `user-management.user-setting.update` that indicates the values of the user's properties after the update request completes.

Depending on the request, you might get additional events with action `user-management.user-setting.update`. If your account is a Lite one, you only get 1 event with action `user-management.user.update`.

For example, see the `requestData` field for the event `user-management.user-setting.update`:

```json
"action": "user-management.user-setting.update",
"message": "User management service: update user settings",
"requestData": {
    "2FA": false,
    "allowed_ip_addresses": "",
    "iam_id": "IBMid-xxxxxxx",
    "origin": "BSS",
    "security_questions_setup": false
}
```
{: screen}

#### Restrict IP addresses
{: #at_events_analyze_3_2}

When you configure IP address restrictions from the **IP address restrictions** section, you get 1 event with action `user-management.user-setting.update`.

For example, see the `requestData` field for the event `user-management.user-setting.update`:

```json
"action": "user-management.user-setting.update",
"message": "User management service: update user settings",
"requestData": {
    "allowed_ip_addresses": "14.15.98.123",
    "iam_id": "IBMid-xxxxxxx",
    "origin": "BSS"
}
```
{: screen}


#### Manage user's login
{: #at_events_analyze_3_3}

When you modify information about a user's login from the **Manage** &gt; **Access IAM** &gt; **Users** &gt; **User Details** section, you get 1 event with action `user-management.user-setting.update`.

See the sample of the `requestData` field when the **User-managed login:** property is disabled:

```json
"action": "user-management.user-setting.update",
 "message": "User management service: update user settings",
"requestData": {
    "iam_id": "IBMid-27000757DW",
    "origin": "BSS",
    "self_manage": false
}
```
{: screen}


See the sample of the `requestData` field when the **User one-time passcode authentication:** property is enabled. The `requestData.2FA` field is set to `true`.

```json
"action": "user-management.user-setting.update",
"message": "User management service: update user settings",
"requestData": {
    "2FA": true,
    "iam_id": "IBMid-xxxxx",
    "origin": "BSS",
    "security_questions_setup": true,
    "self_manage": false
 }
}
```
{: screen}

See the sample of the `requestData` field when the **Require MFA security questions at login:** property is enabled. The `requestData.security_questions_setup` field is set to `true`.

```json
"action": "user-management.user-setting.update",
"message": "User management service: update user settings",
"requestData": {
    "2FA": true,
    "iam_id": "IBMid-xxxxxx",
    "origin": "BSS",
    "security_questions_setup": true,
    "self_manage": false
 }
}
```
{: screen}




#### requestData fields
{: #at_events_analyze_3_reqdata}

The following table lists *requestData* fields that you can find in events that are generated when user details are modified from the **Users** dashboard:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `2FA`                      | Boolean         | Defines the MFA requirements for users in the account.   \n This field is set to `true` when MFA is enabled for users.  |
| `allowed_ip_addresses`     | String          | List of IP addresses from where a user is allowed to access account resources. |
| `iam_id`                   | String          | Defines the IBM ID of the user whose settings are being modified. |
| `security_questions_setup` | Boolean         | Defines when a user requires security questions to log in to the account.   \n This field is set to `true` to indicate that questions are required.  |
| `self_manage`              | Boolean         | Defines whether a user can configure his log in settings on how to log in to the account.    \n This field is set to `true` to allow a user to set password expiration, turn on security questions for login, and define allowed IP addresses for log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and from classic infrastructure API calls.  |

### Account IAM settings events (Deprecated)
{: #at_events_analyze_1}

This section explains events that are generated when you configure the IAM account settings from the **Access (IAM)** &gt; **Settings** dashboard.

#### Configuring MFA
{: #at_events_analyze_1_1}

When you set on MFA in your account by configuring the **Account Login** section in the **Access (IAM)** &gt; **Settings** dashboard, you get 2 events:
* Event with action `billing.account-traits.update` that reports the type of MFA that is configured in the account in the `requestData.mfa` field.
* Event with action `billing.account-mfa.set-on` that indicates that MFA is enabled in the account.

When you set off MFA, you get the following 2 events:
* Event with action `billing.account-traits.update` that reports the type of MFA that is configured in the account in the `requestData.mfa` field.
* Event with action `billing.account-mfa.set-off` that indicates that MFA is disabled in the account.

For example, see the `requestData` field for the event `billing.account-traits.update`:

```json
"action": "billing.account-traits.update",
"message": "Billing service: update account traits",
"requestData": {
    "mfa": "",
    "origin": "BSS"
}

```json
"action": "billing.account-traits.update",
"message": "Billing service: update account traits",
"requestData": {
